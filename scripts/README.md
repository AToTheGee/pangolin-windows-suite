# Automation Scripts

Helper scripts that orchestrate local setup, builds, and releases. They are authored in PowerShell to match the Windows-first environment.

- **dev-setup.ps1** – Bootstraps local prerequisites once actual projects are available.
- **build.ps1** – Placeholder for CI/CD packaging logic.
- **release.ps1** – Planned automation for publishing installers and manifests.

> _Next steps_: Replace placeholders with working commands as soon as binaries exist; ensure each script supports `-WhatIf` for safe dry-runs.
