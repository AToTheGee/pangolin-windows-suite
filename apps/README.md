# Application Modules

The `apps/` directory groups the Windows-facing applications that will ship as part of the Pangolin Windows Suite. Each sub-folder currently contains scaffolding only.

- **newt-gui/** – Planned desktop interface for managing Pangolin Newt nodes.
- **olm-gui/** – Companion UI for Olm control and monitoring.
- **setup-wizard/** – Unified installer and onboarding experience.

> _Contribution tip_: Until real code lands, keep design docs and mockups close to each app folder so implementation teams can pick them up quickly.
